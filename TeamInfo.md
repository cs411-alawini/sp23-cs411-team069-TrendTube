## Project Summary

Our project, TrendTube, is an application that aims to simplify the process of finding, filtering, and choosing trending YouTube videos to watch. It will store a database of trending videos from various different countries. Users can find these videos by using the search bar to filter by title and keywords, and they can order the results by a variety of filters, such as likes, dislikes, region, etc.
Furthermore, we plan to implement more complex features, such as the ability create playlists. Users can create multiple different playlists, and can update them by adding and removing specific videos. Also, we hope to add a recommendation system that looks at a userâ€™s previously watched videos, and then randomly selects a new unwatched video with similar tags.
